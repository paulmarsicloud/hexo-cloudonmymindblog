In my firt official post, I thought it best to guide you through how this blog and site was setup from an idea to legit website.

This blog runs off the following stack:
* AWS (well . . . Route 53 and S3 specifically)
* Terraform
* Hexo
* Hopes and Dreams

## AWS Setups
_Shockingly_ (that's my sarcasm btw . . .) - I already have an AWS account setup already, but I thought it best for this blog to associate a new email account to control this blog.  
> Side note, this is also best practice, please **no one** ever use the root/master user other than when necessary.

### IAM Setups
* I went to IAM > Groups > Create new group, so that I can track the permissions for this new user's group
    * Name group > Attach Policy - you can create your own policy or attach the standard pre-generated policies. I attached a pre-generated policy and plan to scope it in later, stuck with the PowerUserAccess for now.
    * Reviewed and hit complete!
* Then I went back to IAM > Users > Add User
    * New Username generated with both programmatic and Console access (things will be mostly programmatic, but will still need Console access from time to time).
    * Tags > skipped this for now - tags are super powerful for billing and configuration management, but for this blog, it might not be super necessary to tag our one user right now.
    * Complete > Saved the Access Key and Secret Key locally. Definitely going to need those later on during setup, although you can just re-gen those if lost, so no big deal
* Before signing in as the new IAM User; I generated an MFA token as follows:
    * Users > Select User
    * Security Credentials > Assigned MFA Device > Manage
    * Selected Virtual MFA device (you can definitely go for a physical MFA if you have one kicking around...I definitely did not)
    * Keyed in **two consectutive** tokens generated.  I tripped up on this one time previously by entering the same token, twice consecutively and it would not add assign the virtual MFA.  Felt like a proper idiot for a good hour after I realized the misstep.
    * Logged out of the root user and back in with the new acount to confirm all was kosher!

## Domain Purchase and Registration
After deliberating on a domain name, I then had to purchase thecloudonmymind.com domain -  I had the choice between GoDaddy ($14.99 per year), Namecheap ($11.72 per year) and directly through AWS ($12.00 per year).  Decided to keep things simple and buy direct through AWS - although buying through another vendor with a promo code is something I highly recommend!

### Route 53 Setups
* Route 53 > Registered Domains > Register Domain
* ðŸ˜… it was available!

* Decided to register the domain for 1 year - no discount registering for 2+ years or anything, and I am good with reminders on renewals!
> Side note: it may be a good idea to register for the domain for up to 10+ years - the pricing to renew in AWS could go up when you next renew, so you could future protect the price and save money by going longer.  Just a thought.
* Entered my details - I don't have much to hide from the registry office, but I will enable privacy protection, so that my contact info is not exposed for **everyone**
* Reviewed, accepted agreements, verified my email and then completed the order!
* Domain was in the pending status for about 30 mins, but after that it showed as registered:

## Recap
* Setup a fresh IAM user in AWS - please don't use the root/master any more than need be!
* Purchased the domain via Route 53
* Accepted the _risk_ that the domain might cost more than $12.00 to renew in a years time; ok with the trade-off.
